    <h1>Cities that I've lived in</h1>
    <dd>I grew up in Minden, Louisiana and then joined the Air Force. I then moved to Layton, UT as I was stationed at Hill AFB. After Utah I moved to Mildenhall, UK as I worked at RAF Mildenhall. After four years, I moved to Landstuhl, Germany as I transitioned to the Space Force. Finally, I was moved to Baltimore, MD where I currently reside.</dd>

    <h2>Places I want to visit</h2>
    <dd>There are many places I would like to visit, but these are the top three on my list. I chose Copenhagen as the food is said to be incredible. Seattle was chosen as I love coffee and there is a huge coffee industry there. Lastly I chose Outer Banks, NC as it would be awesome to vacation there.</dd>
